# explanation for factory method

it's basically creating a specific type of meal. From an interface it follows a common method 'create meal' that creates a specific meal type. In other words based on what you 'first' select from the prompt (sandwich, burrito, burger) different builder prompts will be run.

# explanation for the builder method

the builder methods that will run is dependent on the meal type generated by factory method, such that generating 'burger' will have builder methods that may not exist in the builder methods of 'burrito'. Once the specific meal is built from the parameters asked from the prompt the console will print out the orders based on the meal built out of the builder pattern.

# notes for usage

when making multiple options, there should be no space after the comma
this (ketchup,mustard) is a valid input but this ( ketup, mustard) or (ketchup, mustard) is not. Assume that input received from user is always in LOWERCASE. The spelling must be correct in order to get valid responses.

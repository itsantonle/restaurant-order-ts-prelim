# explanation for the builder

the builder methods that will run is dependent on the meal type generated by factory method, such that generating 'burger' will have builder methods that may not exist in the builder methods of 'burrito'. Once the specific meal is built from the parameters asked from the prompt the console will print out the orders based on the meal built out of the builder pattern.
